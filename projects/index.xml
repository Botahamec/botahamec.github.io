About This project was created for 43 North&amp;rsquo;s Code:Buffalo hackathon. It&amp;rsquo;s goal is to help people questioning their gender to try different sets of pronouns and see how they like them. This is similar to the technique of trying out names at Starbucks. It&amp;rsquo;s inspired by the Pronoun Dressing Room, which unfortunately has a limited number of stories. This version creates a new story each time.
How it Works The webpage uses HTML, CSS, and TypeScript.</description>

      <description>A helper for git to make some mundane tasks simpler. When you create an empty Github repository normally, you need to do five commands to get your local folder on the remote repository. This application simplifies things dramatically by giving commands which do these things for you automatically.
Building In order to build this, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to have Cargo (the Rust compiler) and Git pre-installed.
 Clone the repository git clone https://github.</description>
