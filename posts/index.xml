      <description>This article is a mess. Sorry.
Background Initially, I was planning on skipping this part. Partly because I figured everyone would know what I&amp;rsquo;m talking about, and partly because I don&amp;rsquo;t really know how to explain it. Although, people reading this in the future will probably need an explanation, so here it is. Instead of explaining it myself, I&amp;rsquo;ll let others explain it for me. Here&amp;rsquo;s a bunch of videos you can watch:</description>

      <description>I have a lot of ideas for future projects. I&amp;rsquo;ll probably never get to do most of them. So let me list some of them so that you may give them a try.
Sudoku Solver Yes, I know many people have done this already. I really like the idea though so I wanna try it without looking at other people&amp;rsquo;s solutions. Of course, you&amp;rsquo;re free to do it in whatever way you like, but you&amp;rsquo;ll probably need a GUI for it.</description>

      <description>Hello, everyone! Welcome to my new site. If you&amp;rsquo;ve seen the old one, then you know that looked remarkably terrible. Not only did it look like a dump, it was horrible to work with. Have you ever tried doing pure HTML code blocks? It&amp;rsquo;s a pain. Now that issue is fixed by using MARKDOWN! Look at this:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15  fn main() { const MAX_NUM = 40; let mut a = 0; let mut b = 1; let mut c; for _i in 0.</description>
