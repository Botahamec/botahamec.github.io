      <description>Last semester, I took a class called, Intro to Moral Issues. One of the assignments we did was a &amp;ldquo;Contemporary Controversy&amp;rdquo;. Each person in the class had to pick a philosophical or political topic and write an essay to convince the class of their position. The professor made it clear that topics relating to media are allowed1.
As it happened, the week before I found out about this, I became curious and read all of the rules of the Death Note.</description>

      <description>This article is a mess. Sorry.
Background Initially, I was planning on skipping this part. Partly because I figured everyone would know what I&amp;rsquo;m talking about, and partly because I don&amp;rsquo;t really know how to explain it. Although, people reading this in the future will probably need an explanation, so here it is. Instead of explaining it myself, I&amp;rsquo;ll let others explain it for me. Here&amp;rsquo;s a bunch of videos you can watch:</description>

      <description>I have a lot of ideas for future projects. I&amp;rsquo;ll probably never get to do most of them. So let me list some of them so that you may give them a try.
Sudoku Solver Yes, I know many people have done this already. I really like the idea though so I wanna try it without looking at other people&amp;rsquo;s solutions. Of course, you&amp;rsquo;re free to do it in whatever way you like, but you&amp;rsquo;ll probably need a GUI for it.</description>

      <description>Hello, everyone! Welcome to my new site. If you&amp;rsquo;ve seen the old one, then you know that looked remarkably terrible. Not only did it look like a dump, it was horrible to work with. Have you ever tried doing pure HTML code blocks? It&amp;rsquo;s a pain. Now that issue is fixed by using MARKDOWN! Look at this:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15  fn main() { const MAX_NUM = 40; let mut a = 0; let mut b = 1; let mut c; for _i in 0.</description>
