      <description>Last semester, I took a class called, Intro to Moral Issues. One of the assignments we did was a &amp;ldquo;Contemporary Controversy&amp;rdquo;. Each person in the class had to pick a philosophical or political topic and write an essay to convince the class of their position. The professor made it clear that topics relating to media are allowed1.
As it happened, the week before I found out about this, I became curious and read all of the rules of the Death Note.</description>
